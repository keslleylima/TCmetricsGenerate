# Test Case Metrics Generator
A simple application that receives as input the test requirements and a set of test paths, to create the following test case metrics:
* AvgPathLength
* Hasloop
* AvgCountLoop
* CountReqPPCCovered
* CountReqECCovered
* PrimePathCoverage
* EdgeCoverage


We developed this tool to generate the defined metrics to build the dataset detailed in "A dataset based on two graph coverage criteria: prime-path and edge coverage"
